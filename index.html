                    <p>To Emily</p>
                    <p>Today you turn 30!</p>
                    <p>
                        In 30 years you have lived a life more than most people ever will. You are the most inspiring person I have ever met. You have a vigour
                        to just do things, experience things, a fearlessness, that I have never seen before. I fell for you because you extended an olive branch
                        to me that no other girl had ever done. You didn't give a shit that I was weird, shy or spergy; you valued my company enough to go out
                        of your way to include me. It helps that you are incredibly easy to talk to. You are the first woman I ever considered a proper friend.
                        You are the first woman I ever confessed my feelings to (and my first rejection lmao). It's because of you I have gained so much
                        confidence talking with women. It's because of you I have 3 wonderful women friends in my life who I have now been on multiple holidays
                        with. I look back at my last decade and most of my best memories are with you.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's always been you.</p>
                    <p>
                        There has never been any pretense with you, no expectations, if you think something will lead to a good time you cannon into it at full
                        speed. It's this mentality that has stuffed your life with experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>But the reality is despite my feelings I didn't actually know you much at all. You aren't the woman I fell in love with.</p>
                    <p>You are so much more.</p>
                    <p>
                        I think the way you live makes it very easy to mistake you for being blas√© and flittering. You changed jobs, you changed house, you
                        changed country, you changed boyfriends. I saw a girl with the purest heart but someone who perhaps didn't invest themselves too deeply
                        into things. But you care more than any person I have ever met in my life. The small things, the big things, the people around you, the
                        world around you. You are both braver and more anxious than I ever could have imagined, at the same time. It's actually insane you have
                        the strength to both worry tremendously and still jump into things head first. On top of that you are both more sweet and more hurt than
                        you ever let on. You are both more independent and more dependent than you ever let on. Both more rational and more irrational than you
                        ever let on. I could go on.

                        I have learnt that I really am just scratching the surface. I can't fully understand the woman whose lived a lifetime by 30 in 1.5
                        months. I'm not sure i'll ever fully understand your past 30 years. But the woman you are is the best person I have ever met. And I want
                        to experience your next 30 years. By your side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want to keep learning about you.
                        <br />I want to keep learning from you. <br />I want to make every single birthday you have better than the last because I understand
                        you that little bit more each time.
                    </p>

                        Emily before I went to Malaga I was speaking with Nick about spilling the beans to you. One of the things on my mind was my belief that
                        30 is actually the real middle of your life. Because human experience of time is logarithmic. In some way I was a bit scared, how much
                        could I actually do in my "second half"? Meeting you has changed my perspective completely. I have experienced more in my past month
                        with you than I would have imagined in 10 years. Through osmosis from you I have been given a taste of how much can be done when you
                        just do. How much time there really is when you actually fill it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Happy Birthday Emily!</p>
                    <p>
                        I hope today is wonderful. <br />I hope tomorrow is wonderful. <br />I hope your next year is wonderful. <br />No person deserves it
                        more than you.
                    </p>

                    <p>Today you turn 30!</p>
                    <p>Welcome to your "second half". <br />Now grab my hand. <br />Let's go fucking live it to it's maximum.</p>

                    <p>Lots and Lots of Love <br />Your Favourite Smoothie <br />Michael xxxx</p>
